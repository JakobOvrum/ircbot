# Lua IRC Bot Framework #

See LICENSE.txt for the license.

See example/plugins/example.lua for a small code sample.

To create a new bot, you can copy the included example/, edit config.lua then add plugins.

The admin.lua plugin is included for commonly used administrative tasks, but isn't necessary.

This project depends on http://github.com/JakobOvrum/LuaIRC, which in turn requires LuaSocket.
